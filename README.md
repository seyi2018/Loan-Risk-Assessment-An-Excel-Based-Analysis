Loan Risk Assessment: An Excel-Based Data Analysis 📊This project utilizes advanced Microsoft Excel techniques—including Pivot Tables, Correlation Analysis (CORREL), and data encoding—to perform a comprehensive risk assessment on a dataset of 2,000 loan applications.The goal was to move beyond surface-level metrics to quantify the true drivers of loan approval and validate the underlying risk strategy of the lender. This document serves as the complete project documentation.🚀 Key Findings & Strategic InsightsThe analysis challenges the assumption that high income guarantees approval, confirming a strong Risk-First Lending Model where past financial behavior is the most critical factor.FeatureCorrelation Strength to Approval (Is Approved)Key Finding / ImplicationPoints (Internal Score)0.821 (Strongest)The single best predictor. This composite score acts as the primary gatekeeper for loan approval.Credit_Score0.716 (Strong)Approval odds increase dramatically above 700. The average approved score was 704 vs. 472 for rejected.Income0.238 (Weakest)Income is a surprisingly weak factor. The lender prioritizes 'Will you pay?' (Credit) over 'Can you pay?' (Income).🛠️ Project Methodology and Skills DemonstratedThe project was executed in three distinct phases, demonstrating proficiency in data wrangling, advanced Excel functions, and data storytelling.1. Data Cleaning and PreparationSource: Loan Assesment Table.xlsx - Assesment Table.csv (2,000 rows).Action: Used basic Data Filtering and Structuring to correct the raw CSV, which contained irrelevant summary rows and inconsistent headers, creating a clean tabular dataset.2. Feature Analysis and EngineeringObjective: Prepare data for quantification and potential ML application.Techniques Used:Label Encoding: Applied to the categorical Name feature to assign a unique integer to each applicant (output: Name_Encoded). This step prepares the data for future use in machine learning models.Filtering for High-Risk Cohorts: Used the Sort Largest to Smallest feature on the Loan_Amount column to identify and rank the Top 5 applicants by loan value, allowing analysts to focus manual review efforts.3. Insight Generation (Questions Answered)Tools: Pivot Tables, AVERAGE, and the CORREL function.Key Questions Answered:Correlation Quantification: Used the CORREL function to measure the precise linear relationship between all numerical features (Income, Credit_Score, Points) and the Is Approved outcome.Threshold Identification: Created Pivot Tables with Grouping on Credit_Score to identify critical approval bands (e.g., the jump in approval rates when the score crosses 700).Descriptive Statistics: Calculated the average Credit Score and Years Employed for both Approved and Rejected cohorts to quantify the difference between a high-risk and low-risk applicant.📂 Repository ContentsFile/FolderPurposedata/Contains the original raw dataset and the clean, engineered data (loan_assessment_with_name_encoding.csv).excel_outputs/Contains key analysis sheets exported from Excel, including the final insights summary and core Pivot Tables (e.g., approval rates by credit band).Loan_Analysis_Dashboard.xlsxThe complete Excel workbook containing all raw data, pivots, and calculations.
